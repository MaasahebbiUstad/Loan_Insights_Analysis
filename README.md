## Data Cleaning Steps:

* **Handling Null Values:**
  
     Identify columns with null values and choose a strategy for handling them.

* **Addressing '-' in 'ptp_date‘ and ‘reason’:**

     Identify instances of '-' in 'ptp_date'  and reason field and apply appropriate handling.

* **Data Type Conversions:**
  
     Check and convert data types for consistency (e.g., 'dialed_time' to datetime).

* **Duplicate Removal:**

  Identify and analyze duplicates, deciding on a strategy for removal.
